<fieldset id="intro"><legend>intro</legend>Football is a family of team sports that involve kicking a ball to score a goal.
    Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.
   There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.
   Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.
   The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football 
   to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century,
    distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incor porated
   the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.
   In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions.
    During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</textarea>

      <legend>components of football</legend>
      the current famous football which is normally called as soccer in some countries use kicking codes 
      where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.
<br><br>
Common rules among football include:
<ul class="li1">
    <li>Two teams of 11 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular
        such as street footbal and in the covered halls.</li>
        <li>
            A clearly defined area in which to play the game called the pitch consists formally
            of green grass in a stadium.
        </li>    
    <li>
        Scoring goals by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field either into the goal
        goal if the ball crosses the line of thee goal. 
    </li>    
    <li>
        Goals resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts
        between the crossbar and the two posts
        with its whole surface.
    </li>    
    <li>
        The goal or line being defended by the opposing team.
    </li>    
    <li>
        Players using only their body to move the ball that they are permitted to move
        the ball using their hands or arms.
    </li>    
</ul>

common skills in football include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.
In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring
 a goal must put the ball under the crossbar and between the goalposts.

<legend>history of football</legend>
    
    Ancient China
    <br>
    The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠) resembles modern association football (soccer),
    descriptions appear in a military manual dated to the second and third centuries BC.
    It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC.
    The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period.
    This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD.
    In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other,
    trying not to let the ball drop to the ground.
    <br><br>

    Ancient Greece and Rome
    <br>
    The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet.
    The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as "ἐπίσκυρος"
    which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian
    theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These games appear to have resembled rugby football.
    The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave
    when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis.
     Episkyros is recognised as an early form of football by <abbr title="Fédération Internationale de Football Association">FIFA</abbr>.
    <br><br>
    Native Americans
    <br>
    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous
    peoples in many different parts of the world. For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English
    explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.
    There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk. Each match began with two teams
    facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and
    then at a goal. In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native
    Americans, called Pahsaheman. Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar to modern-day association football played amongst
    Amerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th century.
    <br>
    Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since 
    before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been 
    found between such games and modern football sports. Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois
    Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it 
    is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of
    "football."
    <br><br>
    Oceania <br>
    On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed
    balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for "game ball").
    The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 in which a man called Richard Thomas
    is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people
    playing the game: "Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin 
    of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it." Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football.
    <br>
    These games and others may well go far back into antiquity.
    However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe,
    especially England.
    <br><br>
    Turkic peoples <br>
    Mahmud al-Kashgari in his Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk, described a game called "tepuk" among Turks
    in Central Asia. In the game, people try to attack each other's castle by kicking a ball 
    made of sheep leather.
    
    <br><br>
    Medieval and early modern Europe <br>
    The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, 
    particularly in England. An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th century 
    Historia Brittonum, which describes "a party of boys ... playing at ball".
    References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule, in which the ball was 
    propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century.
    
    The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as "mob football",
    would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of 
    players on opposing teams who would clash en masse, struggling to move an item, such as inflated
    animal's bladder to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking
    place in the open space between neighbouring parishes. The game was played primarily during significant 
    religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter, and Shrovetide games have survived into 
    the modern era in a number of English towns.
    <br>
    Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of "ball play" or "playing at ball". 
    This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.
    <br>
    An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, 
    England: "Henry... while playing at ball.. ran against David". Football was played in Ireland in 1308, 
    with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a "football game" at Newcastle, County Down 
    being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. Another reference 
    to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: "during the game at ball as he
    kicked the ball, a lay friend of his... ran against him and wounded himself".
    <br>
    In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football 
    in the French used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads:
    "for as much as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls 
    in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command 
    and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city 
    in the future." This is the earliest reference to football.
    <br>
    In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning "...handball, football, or hockey; 
    coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games", showing that "football" – whatever 
    its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, 
    such as handball.
    
    A game known as "football" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was 
    prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906. 
    There is evidence for schoolboys playing a "football" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) 
    which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word 
    "pass" in the most recent translation is derived from "huc percute" (strike it here) and later 
    "repercute pilam" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball 
    was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as "goal" is "metum", 
    literally meaning the "pillar at each end of the circus course" in a Roman chariot race. 
    There is a reference to "get hold of the ball before [another player] suggesting that 
    handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation 
    "Throw yourself against him" (Age, objice te illi).
    <br>
    King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented 
    uses of the English word "football", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation 
    forbidding the levying of money for "foteball".
    
    There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire. This is the first description of a "kicking game" and the first description of dribbling: "the game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: "the boundaries have been marked and the game had started.
    <br><br>
    Calcio Fiorentino <br>
    
    In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as "calcio storico" in the Piazza Santa Croce. The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football. For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).
    <br><br>
    Official disapproval and attempts to ban football <br>
    There have been many attempts to ban football, from the middle ages through to the modern day. The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667. Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s. Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.
    
    American football also faced pressures to ban the sport. The game played in the 19th century resembled mob football that developed in medieval Europe, including a version popular on university campuses known as Old division football, and several municipalities banned its play in the mid-19th century. By the 20th century, the game had evolved to a more rugby style game. In 1905, there were calls to ban American football in the U.S. due to its violence; a meeting that year was hosted by American president Theodore Roosevelt led to sweeping rules changes that caused the sport to diverge significantly from its rugby roots to become more like the sport as it is played today.
